            <p>I have been subscribed to Migaku for a whilel but I haven't started immersing until recently. I'm starting of slow, using beginner Japanese videos suggested on the Migaku discord. I'm trying to find good works to sentence mine. It is a little difficult though. I'm sure i'll figure it out eventually... That's basically it. I don't know what else to write.</p>
