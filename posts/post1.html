            <h2>My First Post</h2>
            <p class="date">February 9, 2025</p>
            <p>I'm really excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences. Here's a list of things I plan to write about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technology</li>
                <li>Travel</li>

            <p>The digital echoes of gunfire reverberated through the speakers as Alex, a seasoned Counter-Strike player, found himself in a tense standoff. Years of dedication had led to this moment: a crucial tournament in Nagasaki, with a coveted spot in the global championships on the line. His fingers danced across the keyboard, muscle memory honed from countless hours in the game. As the round commenced, Alex, playing as a Counter-Terrorist, moved cautiously to defuse a bomb. The enemy team, a notorious group known for their aggressive strategies, pushed forward, their digital footsteps growing louder. Alexâ€™s teammate fell, leaving him alone to face the onslaught. He took cover, his heart pounding in sync with the ticking bomb. With precise aim, Alex eliminated two opponents, but the remaining terrorist advanced, weapon raised. In a split-second decision, Alex lunged forward, firing a final burst that sealed his victory. The crowd erupted as Alex secured the round, his team edging closer to the grand final.
